      <h2>WELCOME TO THE GOLDEN STATE - CALIFORNIA!</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>California is on the west coast of the U.S. and was admitted to the Union on September 9, 1850, making it the
        31st
        official state to join the ranks. California’s nickname, the “Golden State,” can be traced back to the discovery
        of gold
        and the California Gold Rush that occurred in the late 19th century. The state is famous for its warm and sunny
        climate,
        sandy beaches, populated cities, and its laid-back lifestyle. The Golden State is also known for its nine
        amazing
        national parks, tall trees, and grizzly bears!
        <br>
        English and Spanish are the most spoken languages in California. The capital city of California is Sacramento.
        It
        became
        the state’s capital in 1854, replacing former capitals such as Monterey and San Jose. Although Sacramento is the
        capital
        city, Los Angeles stands as the most populous city in California, with a staggering population of nearly 4
        million
        people (according to the 2020 United States census).
        <br>
        California is a Democratic-leaning state. The current governor of California is the democrat politician and
        businessman
        Gavin Newsom, who has been in his post since January 7, 2019. The two politicians representing California in the
        U.S.
        Senate in 2022 are Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla.

          <h3>Golden Bridge</h3>
          <p>Crossing the strait of the Golden Gate from San Francisco’s Presidio to the Marin headlands is the
            world-renowned Golden
            Gate Bridge, easily identified by its International Orange color. </p>

          <p> Once called “the bridge that couldn’t be
            built,” today
            the Golden Gate Bridge is one the seven wonders of the modern world. This magnificent span, perhaps San
            Francisco’s most
            famous landmark, opened in 1937 after a four-year struggle against relentless winds, fog, rock and
            treacherous
            tides.</p>

          <h3>Hollywood Sign</h3>
          <p>The talk is about the Hollywood Sign overlooking the neighborhood of Hollywood in the world-renowned city
            of
            Los
            Angeles.

            It’s not only the city’s number one attraction but also one of the most famous landmarks in California!

            The sign was initially created as an advertisement for a local real estate agency in 1923. However, over the
            years, it
            got more and more recognition so people decided to just leave it up.

            Nowadays, the Hollywood Sign frequently appears in establishing shots for different movies and series set in
            and
            around
            Hollywood.</p>

          <h3>Santa Monica Pier</h3>
          <p>Believe it or not, The Santa Monica Pier has been around since 1909! A rich and
            illustrious past is what makes the Pier so enchanting. Originally built as a public
            utility for the city of Santa Monica, the Pier has undergone an incredible transformation
            since it was first constructed. As a National Historic Landmark, the Santa Monica
            Pier retains a nostalgia of days long past and remains a true icon today.</p>
